The Web Enablement team takes security seriously, and we follow all recommendations from the [Google/Angular team](https://angular.dev/best-practices/security). If you believe you have found a security issue within this library, please submit a [new security vulnerability bug report](https://github.com/ford-innersource/devenablement.wame.frf-starter/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.yml&title=Security%20Vulnerability) to this repository.

If this is an urgent issue, or you need clarification, feel free to reach out to us using one of the communication channels outlined in the [Getting Help section of the README](README.md#getting-help).
